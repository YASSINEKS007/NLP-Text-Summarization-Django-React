# Advanced Text Summarization Web Platform

## Overview
This project is a fully secured web platform designed for advanced text summarization. It combines cutting-edge AI models with a robust web architecture built using **Django** for the backend, **React.js** for the frontend, and **PostgreSQL** for data storage. The platform employs **JWT-based authentication** to ensure security and integrates AI-powered text summarization that combines extractive and generative methods for high-quality results.

## Features
- **AI-Driven Summarization**: Combines enhanced TextRank with sentence clustering and LLM refinement for fluent, coherent summaries.
- **Secure Authentication**: Implements JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure user authentication and session management.
- **Modern Web Stack**: Built using Django (backend), React.js (frontend), and PostgreSQL (database).
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive UI for users to input text, manage summaries, and view results.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large-scale text data efficiently.

## Methodology

This platform employs an innovative, hybrid approach to text summarization that integrates **extractive techniques** with **generative refinement** for producing fluent, coherent summaries. The process is divided into several stages:

---

### 1. Sentence Clustering
To improve the coverage of key ideas in the text, we introduce **sentence clustering** as a preprocessing step:
- **Semantic Representation**:
  - Each sentence in the input text is converted into a numerical vector representation using **word embeddings** (Sentence-BERT).
- **Clustering**:
  - Sentences are grouped into clusters based on their semantic similarity using clustering algorithms such as **K-means**.
  - This ensures that diverse and important ideas are represented in the summary, avoiding redundancy.
- **Representative Sentence Selection**:
  - From each cluster, the most representative sentence is chosen based on its centrality.

---

### 2. Enhanced TextRank
The platform uses an enhanced version of the **TextRank algorithm**:
- **Graph Construction**:
  - Sentences are treated as nodes in a graph.
  - Edges between sentences are weighted based on semantic similarity, calculated using cosine similarity of their vector representations.
- **Ranking**:
  - TextRank iteratively scores sentences using a graph-based ranking model, similar to Google's PageRank algorithm.
- **Cluster-Aware Selection**:
  - By applying TextRank within each cluster, the algorithm ensures better coverage of key ideas and prioritizes high-ranking sentences.

---

### 3. LLM Refinement
After extracting top-ranked sentences, they are passed to a **Large Language Model (LLM)** for further refinement:
- **Coherence Improvement**:
  - The LLM ("nvidia/llama-3.1-nemotron-70b-instruct") rephrases and organizes the extracted sentences to enhance readability and logical flow.
- **Fluency Enhancement**:
  - By leveraging the LLMâ€™s generative capabilities, the summary becomes more human-like, avoiding the choppy style often produced by extractive methods.
- **Context Preservation**:
  - The LLM integrates contextual cues from the text to ensure the summary remains accurate and concise.

---

### 4. Evaluation
Traditional metrics like ROUGE and BLEU focus on surface-level comparisons, which may not always align with human perceptions of summary quality. Instead, the platform incorporates **LLM-based evaluation**:
- **Fluency and Coherence Scoring**:
  - The LLM is used to assess the overall quality of generated summaries, providing scores for fluency, coherence, and contextual relevance.
- **Comparative Metrics**:
  - While LLM-based evaluation is the primary method, ROUGE scores are also calculated to compare performance with conventional approaches.

---

### 5. Integration into the Platform
- **Web Interface**:
  - Users interact with the summarization system through an intuitive web UI where they can upload text, manage summaries, and view results.
- **Customizable Preferences**:
  - Users can choose settings such as summary length or level of abstraction.
- **Real-Time Processing**:
  - The summarization process, powered by a combination of Django and AI models, ensures near real-time results.

By combining the precision of extractive methods, the fluency of generative techniques, and advanced evaluation metrics, this platform delivers high-quality summaries tailored to diverse user needs.
